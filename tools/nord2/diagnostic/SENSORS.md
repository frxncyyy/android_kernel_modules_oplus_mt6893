# Sensors on the port (reconnaissance, round 4)

## What the device has

From the live stock ColorOS `dumpsys sensorservice` plus `/sys/bus/i2c/devices`:

| sensor | chip | bus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| accelerometer | `lsm6dso` (STMicro) | i2c |
| gyroscope | `lsm6dso` (STMicro) | i2c |
| magnetometer | `mmc5603` (Memsic) | i2c |
| proximity / ambient light | `tcs3701` (AMS) | i2c |

Stock additionally exposes the MTK synthetic sensors (uncalibrated mag/gyro,
significant motion, step detector/counter, device orientation, stationary
detect).  Those are computed in the hub and need no extra chip driver.

## What the port has

* Userspace is fine.  The port runs the stock vendor partition, which ships
  `sensors.mt6893.so`, `android.hardware.sensors@2.X-subhal-mediatek.so` and
  `/vendor/etc/sensors/hals.conf`.  Nothing to do there.
* Kernel side is missing.  The staging directory ships **no** sensor module at
  all, so `/dev/hf_manager` and the hub character devices never appear.
* The reference chip drivers that do exist in
  `drivers/misc/mediatek/sensors-1.0/` are for other boards - `mc3410-i2c`,
  `ITG1010`, `akm09918`, `cm36558`, `ltr303`.  None of them is a Nord 2 part,
  and `lsm6dso`, `mmc5603` and `tcs3701` do not appear anywhere in either the
  6.6 or the 4.19 source tree.
* That is not automatically fatal, because this port is configured for the
  sensor **2.0** architecture (`CONFIG_MTK_SENSOR_ARCHITECTURE="2.0"`,
  `CONFIG_MTK_SENSOR_SUPPORT=m`), where the chip drivers live in the **hub
  firmware**, not in the kernel.  `drivers/misc/mediatek/sensor/2.0/mtk_nanohub/nanohub/`
  is transport only - `comms.c`, `main.c`, `nanohub-mtk.c` - plus
  `sensor_list.c`, the table the AP side publishes to userspace.  So the stock
  hub firmware already knows how to talk to the lsm6dso, mmc5603 and tcs3701,
  and the kernel only has to reach the hub.

## The actual blocker

`hf_manager.ko` and `nanohub.ko` already build, but nothing loads them and the
hub is unreachable:

* `# CONFIG_MTK_SCP is not set` - nanohub registers its IPI mailbox through
  `scp_ipi_register()` (`mtk_nanohub_ipi.c`), so without the SCP driver there is
  no transport at all.
* `# CONFIG_MTK_SENSORHUB is not set` and `# CONFIG_CUSTOM_KERNEL_SENSORHUB_1_0
  is not set`; the 2.0 tree is reached through `CUSTOM_KERNEL_SENSORHUB`.
* Neither module is copied into the image.

## Next step

Enable the SCP stack (`CONFIG_MTK_SCP`, the tinysys/SCP driver and its
dependencies) so `scp.ko` provides the IPI transport, then ship
`hf_manager.ko`, `nanohub.ko` and the sensor-list module and check
`dumpsys sensorservice` on the port for the four real sensors.  The stock `scp`
and `nanohub` partitions are untouched, so the firmware half is already in
place.

Watch item: the SCP owns some power-domain and low-power sequencing, so this
change has to be re-checked against suspend and the AOD path, not just against
sensors.

Side note worth remembering: stock's `lux_aodhub` - the light sensor feed that
gates AOD brightness - comes from this same stack.  Until the hub is up, AOD
cannot react to ambient light, which is the remaining half of the AOD
calibration item.
